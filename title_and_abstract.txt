Title:

Tackle Programming Tedium with Python Data Classes and YAML 

Abstract: 

A common and tedious programming task is reading and writing small amounts of 
data, for example program parameters or configuration values, to and from 
files. You can spend a significant amount of time writing and maintaining 
custom code to handle this.

A better solution is to leverage the Python yaml and dataclasses libraries.

In this beginner level workshop we will explore how to use python data 
classes and YAML to store and retrieve sets of related data values, learn
about the power of data classes, and play with Python decorators.

To participate in the class you will need a bit of python experience and 
a laptop.
