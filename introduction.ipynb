    "A common programming task is to read small amounts of data from files, or format and write that data back to files. These data could be program parameters or configuration values for example. You can spend a significant amount of time writing custom code to parse configuration files, pass these values around in your program, format and write them back to files. All of that code requires maintenance - the addition of a new parameter can entail changing multiple places in your code.\n",
